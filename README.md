bytterfs
========
Bytterfs - shortel for Backup python Butterfs - is a backup script using btrfs send/receive feature to incrementally backup
via SSH to a remote server.

####  Usage description
```
usage: bytterfs.py [-h] -p SSHPORT -i SSHKEY -dk DESTKEEP<br>
                   snapshotName source destRootSubvol destContainer sshHost<br>

bytterfs. Incremental Backup helper for btrfs send/receive over SSH. Make sure<br>
that the SSH user has added following sudo rights in /etc/sudoers<br>

username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/btrfs subvol delete*<br>
username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/btrfs subvol list*<br>

This way you can run latter commands with sudo and don't have to type in the<br>
password. This is more secure, than connecting with SSH as root to the<br>
destination server. Also make sure that you have already created a subvolume on<br>
the backup destination which holds all your backup for the specific source. <br>

positional arguments:<br>
  snapshotName          Name of snapshot. A timestamp will then be suffixed to<br>
                        it. E.g.: rootfs_1418415962.<br>
  source                Source subvolume to backup. Local path or SSH url.<br>
  destRootSubvol        Destination root subvolume. This parameter is required<br>
                        to verify, that the specified destinationContainer is<br>
                        existent on the destination root subvolume.<br>
  destContainer         Destination container subvolume path, where snapshots<br>
                        are send to.<br>
  sshHost               E.g.: user@192.168.1.100.<br>

optional arguments:<br>
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit<br>
  -p SSHPORT, --sshPort SSHPORT<br>
                        SSH Port.<br>
  -i SSHKEY, --sshKey SSHKEY<br>
                        Path to your private key for your SSH user.<br>
  -dk DESTKEEP, --destKeep DESTKEEP<br>
                        Maximum number of destination snapshots to keep for a<br>
                        specific amount of time. Syntax example: <br>
                        5w=6,4m=3,6m=2,12m=3. Which means that at maximum 6<br>
                        snapshots will be kept of the last 5 weeks, maximum 3  <br> 
                        snapshots will be kept within the time span of 5 weeks<br>
                        and 4 month, maximum 2 snapshots wil be kept from the<br>
                        time span of 4 months until 6 months and maximum 3<br>
                        snapshots will be kept from the time span of 6 until<br>
                        12 months. Only w for weeks and m for months is<br>
                        accepted syntax. Abstract: <time span>[w|m]= <number <br>
                        of snapshots>optional(<comma as delimiter>)... Notice<br>
                        that the next specified time span has to be greater<br>
                        than the previous, else the parameter will yield an<br>
                        error.<br><br>
```          

#### Features:
- Rotating snapshots on backup destination
- syslog Logging
- lockfile for interrupted backups and trying to fix interrupted backups next run
- mail notification, requires gymail. see: (https://github.com/eayin2/gymail) <br>

#### Preparations:<br>
Before using this backup script you should prepare following things:<br>
- Create a subvolume on the backup destination, which will hold/contain the <br>
   Backups/Snapshots. E.g. /mnt/3tb/@rootfs/  which will then hold e.g. backups as <br>
   such: /mnt/3tb/@rootfs/@rootfs_1418932376   <br>
- If you don't use root to connect to your backup destination (which is recommended,  <br>
   because if you many clients accessing your backup destination you would increase  <br>
   the risk for a rogue client), then you have to add: <br>
   username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/btrfs subvol delete*<br>
   username ALL=NOPASSWD: /usr/bin/btrfs subvol list*<br>
   to /etc/sudoers<br>

#### Requirements: <br>
- btrfs-utils
- qymail script (https://github.com/eayin2/gymail) 
  --> Notice: Create a symlink to /usr/local/bin/sendmail.py for the script. `ln -s /path/script /usr/local/bin/sendmail.py`
  (If you dont want to use it then just remove all sendmail lines)
- python3<br>

#### Notice:<br>
- This script only supports btrfs send/receive operations from a local to an SSH remote machine.<br>
- Only one snapshot is kept on the client and only the destination will hold multiple snapshots<br>
  (see parameter syntax infos above). You can modify/extend this script to store more than one<br>
  snapshot on the client. I did not do it, because I use an SSD on my client and don't want to<br>
  store multiple snapshots on my client.<br>

#### Example Usage: <br>
```
sudo ./bytterfs.py @home /home/ /mnt/3tb/ /mnt/3tb/@home/ user@192.168.1.100 -p 22 -i /home/user/.ssh/id_rsa -dk 1m=6,4m=6,10=5
```<br>
